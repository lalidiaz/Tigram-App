Built in ReactJs, this is the final project of the Advanced React course at Platzi.
From the beginning I was refactoring the code and learning new concepts.
You will find in this code:
‚Ä¢ Styled-Components library.
‚Ä¢ Reach / Router for routes.
‚Ä¢ Keyframes animations.
‚Ä¢ Creation and use of hooks.
‚Ä¢ Local Storage.
‚Ä¢ Graphql and React Apollo. React Helmet for SEO.

Feel free to have a look.
